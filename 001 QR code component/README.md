## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- Flexbox
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor

### What I learned

This is my first time using SCSS, that's why I chose a simple project to start
off. I learned a lot about syntax of SCSS, which is very similar to CSS.

Example of SCSS variables:
```css
$font-size: 1rem; // 16px
$dark-blue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
$font-stack: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
```
